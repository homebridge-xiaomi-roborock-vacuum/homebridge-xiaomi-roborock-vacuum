# homebridge-xiaomi-roborock-vacuum

## Homebridge plugin for Xiaomi / Roborock Vacuum Cleaner's

This [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) plugin allows you to control the Xiaomi vacuum robots in your Apple Home App (HomeKit).

It is currently presented in the Home App in the form of a Fan because Apple don't officially support Vacuums in Homekit (we can't wait for this moment to arrive)!

For the underlying communication layer, it uses a port of the no-longer maintained library [miio](https://github.com/aholstenson/miio). You'll find the code in the directory [./miio](./miio).

## Features

- **Fan** as On-/Off-Switch. When switching off, directly back to the charging station.
  - [Fanspeed levels](./models/speedmodes.js) adjustable via 3D Touch / Force Touch.
- Battery status and condition in the device details. Low battery alert.
- Pause switch (optional).
- Room cleaning (optional): Read [Room cleaning](#room-cleaning) to understand how it works.
- Zone cleaning (optional).
- Occupancy sensor (similar to motion sensor) for dock status (optional).
- Second Fan for water box modes (optional).
  - [Watermode levels](./models/watermodes.js) only when enabled in config, and the device supports it.

## Instructions

1. Install the plugin as `root` (`sudo su -`) with `npm install -g homebridge-xiaomi-roborock-vacuum@latest --unsafe-perm`.
2. Customize you homebridge configuration `config.json`.
3. Restart homebridge, ggf. `service homebridge restart`.

- Example `config.json` with one vacuum and room cleaning:

```
"accessories": [
 {
  "accessory": "XiaomiRoborockVacuum",
  "name": "Xiaomi Mi Robot Vaccum 1st Generation",
  "ip": "192.168.1.150",
  "token": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
  "pause": false,
  "dock": true,
  "waterBox": false,
  "cleanword": "cleaning",
  "rooms": [
    {
      "id": 16,
      "name": "Livingroom"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "name": "Kitchen"
    }
  ],
  "zones": [
    {
      "name":"Family Room (x2)",
      "zone":[[25000,25000,32000,32000,2]]

    {
      "name":"Bedroom",
      "zone":[[21000,32000,24000,37000,1]]
    },
    {
      "name":"Bedroom & Family Room",
      "zone":[ [21000,32000,24000,37000,1],  [25000,25000,32000,32000,1]]
    }
  ]
 }
],
```

- Example `config.json` with two vacuums:

```
"accessories": [
 {
  "accessory": "XiaomiRoborockVacuum",
  "name": "Xiaomi Mi Robot Vaccum 1st Generation",
  "ip": "192.168.1.150",

## Room cleaning

This plugin supports Room cleaning (only models that support room cleaning via the Xiaomi Mi Home app). Keep reading to understand how it works and how to set it up.

### How it works

To start the Room Clean Mode, you can enable/disable the room switches in the 
order that they need to be cleaned. Then turn on the main Fan switch to start 
the actual cleaning.

### How can I set it up

#### Semi automatic

This feature seems to work with all models which offer room cleaning, but may not work on newer firmware versions (3.5.8_0358 or newer). To use it:

1. Set the `autoroom` property in the config to an array of room names (`["my room 1", "my room 2", "my room 3"]`.
2. In the Xiaomi Mi app, setup a timer at midnight (00:00 or 12:00am).
3. Enable `Select a room to divide`.
4. On the map select the rooms in the order as they appear in the config set in step 1. The order is important as this is how the plugin maps the room names to IDs.
5. Submit the timer and make sure it's deactivated.
6. Restart `homebridge`.

#### Fully automatic

This feature seems to be working on models that support naming the rooms in the Xiaomi / Roborock App. This is known to include the Roborock S6 as well as the S4 with firmware version 3.5.8_0358 or newer.

Even if you have one of these models but you haven't named the Rooms in your App yet, this function will not work! Thanks @domeOo

## Xiaomi Token

To use this plugin, you have to read the "token" of the xiaomi vacuum robots. Here are some detailed instructions:

- :us::gb: - [python-miio - Getting started](https://python-miio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery.html)
- :de: - [Apple HomeKit Forum - HomeKit.Community](https://forum.smartapfel.de/forum/thread/370-xiaomi-token-auslesen/)
- :de: - [Homematic-Guru.de](https://homematic-guru.de/xiaomi-vacuum-staubsauger-roboter-mit-homematic-steuern)

NOTE: We are not currently aware of how to retrieve the token from the Roborock App. Please, share any findings in the issue #104.

## Is my model supported?

As new users join our community, and use this plugin, we try to learn from their device, and keep up with the new devices Xiaomi releases. However, the main developer @afharo, only owns the model S5, and he can't test the features on other models. If you wonder whether your device is supported, please:
 
1. Check the [./models/models.js](./models/models.js) file to see if your device is already in the explicit list.
2. If not, maybe it matches de _default_ behaviour (just try running the plugin and see if it works).
    1. If it works, but the vacuum modes (aka speeds) are wrong: add your model to the list in 1 with the right mapping.
    2. If it doesn't work, please, try making sure the IP and token are correct, by running the command `miio-vacuum inspect id-or-address --token tokenAsHex`.  
    HINT: Try a couple of times, just in case there's a network glitch.
    3. If you can connect and see the details of your robot, try running the manual commands like explained in [here](./miio/docs/protocol.md#testing-commands).  
    HINT: You can find the list of commands for your device in the Python project [python-miio](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio).

## My model is, allegedly, supported, but it fails to connect

Run the command `miio-vacuum inspect id-or-address --token tokenAsHex`, replacing `id-or-address` with your vacuum's IP address and the `tokenAsHex` with a HEX representation of the token obtained [earlier](#xiaomi-token).
