## Instructions

1. Install git packages first with `sudo apt install git`.
2. Install the plugin as `root` (`sudo su -`) with `npm install -g homebridge-xiaomi-roborock-vacuum@latest --unsafe-perm`.
3. Customize you homebridge configuration `config.json`.
4. Restart homebridge, ggf. `service homebridge restart`.

- Example `config.json` with one vacuum and room cleaning:

```
"accessories": [
 {
  "accessory": "XiaomiRoborockVacuum",
  "name": "Xiaomi Mi Robot Vaccum 1st Generation",
  "ip": "192.168.1.150",
  "token": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
  "pause": false,
  "dock": true,
  "waterBox": false,
  "cleanword": "cleaning",
  "rooms": [
    {
      "id": 16,
      "name": "Livingroom"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "name": "Kitchen"
    }
  ],
  "zones": [
 {
      "name":"Family Room (x2)",
      "zone":[[25000,25000,32000,32000,2]]
    },
    {
      "name":"Bedroom",
      "zone":[[21000,32000,24000,37000,1]]
    },
    {
      "name":"Bedroom & Family Room",
      "zone":[ [21000,32000,24000,37000,1],  [25000,25000,32000,32000,1]]
    }
  ]
 }
],
```

- Example `config.json` with two vacuums:

```
"accessories": [
 {
  "accessory": "XiaomiRoborockVacuum",
  "name": "Xiaomi Mi Robot Vaccum 1st Generation",
  "ip": "192.168.1.150",

## AutoRoom Generation

### Semi automatic

This feature seems to work with all models which offer room cleaning, but may not work on newer firmware versions (3.5.8_0358 or newer). To use it:

1. Set the `autoroom` property in the config to an array of room names (`["my room 1", "my room 2", "my room 3"]`.
2. In the Xiaomi Mi app, setup a timer at midnight (00:00 or 12:00am).
3. Enable `Select a room to divide`.
4. On the map select the rooms in the order as they appear in the config set in step 1. The order is important as this is how the plugin maps the room names to IDs.
5. Submit the timer and make sure it's deactivated.
6. Restart `homebridge`.

### Fully automatic

This feature seems to be working on models that support naming the rooms in the Xiaomi / Roborock App. This is known to include the Roborock S6 as well as the S4 with firmware version 3.5.8_0358 or newer.

Even if you have one of these models but you haven't named the Rooms in your App yet, this function will not work! Thanks @domeOo

## Room Clean Mode

To start the Room Clean Mode, you can enable/disable the room switches in the 
order that they need to be cleaned. Then turn on the main Fan switch to start 
the actual cleaning.

## Xiaomi Token

To use this plugin, you have to read the "token" of the xiaomi vacuum robots. Here are some detailed instructions:
